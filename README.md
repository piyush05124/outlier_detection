## what is an Outlier ?
An outlier is a data point that significantly differs from other observations in a dataset. üßê
Think of it like a single bright red apple in a basket full of green apples. This red apple stands out because it's distinctly different from the rest.
Outliers can occur for various reasons:
1. Measurement errors: The measuring instrument might have been faulty.
2. Data entry errors: Typos can happen when data is manually entered.
3. Experimental errors: Mistakes during an experiment can lead to unusual readings.
4. Novelty or genuine rare events: Sometimes, an outlier represents a truly unusual and valid occurrence in the data. For example, a very high daily sales figure might be due to a legitimate, unexpected surge in demand.
It's important to identify outliers because they can skew statistical analyses and machine learning models, leading to misleading conclusions or poor performance. Depending on the cause and the goal of the analysis, outliers might be removed, corrected (if possible), or investigated further.
